CatalystX::DBIC::Trace

Log all SQL queries executed by DBIC at the end of each request.

Hopefully further extend to support timing queries, a UI to list recent
requests and all their queries, and list recent queries by time to identify
slow ones, etc.

In particular, using a debugobj() instead of debugfh() so we can log every
query as it's run (in case one hangs) as well as getting info on the time
they took.

FIXME: generate a full README.
